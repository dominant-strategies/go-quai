## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://docs.quai.network/develop/installation).

First, clone the repository and navigate to it using
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quai.git
$ cd go-quai
```

Next, you will need to copy some default environment variables to your machine. You can do this by running 

```shell
$ cp network.env.dist network.env
```

Building `go-quai` requires both a Go (version 1.19 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favorite package manager. Once these dependencies are installed, run

```shell
$ make go-quai
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
$ make all
```

## Executables

The go-quai project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|    Command    | Description |
| :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **`go-quai`**   | Our main Quai CLI client. It is the entry point into the Quai network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Quai network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `go-quai --help` for command line options.|
|  **`test`** | Runs a battery of tests on the repository to ensure it builds and functions correctly.|

## Running `go-quai`

### Full node on the main Quai network

Using the makefile will preload configuration values from the `network.env` file.
```shell
$ make run-all
```

### Full node on the Garden test network
Garden test network is based on the Blake3 proof-of-work consensus algorithm. As such,
it has certain extra overhead and is more susceptible to reorganization attacks due to the
network's low difficulty/security.

Modify the `network.env` configuration file to reflect:
`NETWORK=garden`. You should also set `ENABLE_ARCHIVE=true` to make sure to save the trie-nodes after you stop your node. Then build and run with the same commands as mainnet.

### Configuration

Configuration is handled in `network.env.dist` file. You will need to copy or rename the file to `network.env`. The make commands will automatically pull from this file for configuration changes.
